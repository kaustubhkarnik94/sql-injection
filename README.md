# SQL Injection Learning Path

This repository contains a series of SQL Injection challenges and solutions, based on the PortSwigger SQL Injection Learning Path. The challenges are designed to help security professionals, ethical hackers, and learners practice and understand the vulnerabilities associated with SQL injection in web applications.

## Overview

SQL Injection (SQLi) is one of the most common and dangerous web application vulnerabilities. This repository provides a hands-on approach to learning and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities. It includes a variety of labs that cover different aspects of SQL injection, from basic exploitation to advanced techniques.

The labs in this repository are based on the SQL Injection learning path provided by PortSwigger. Each lab is accompanied by a solution script written by me, demonstrating the steps to exploit the vulnerability, along with explanations and comments to help learners understand the underlying concepts.

## Learning Path

The learning path includes the following key topics:

- **Introduction to SQL Injection**: Understanding the basics of SQL injection, how it works, and why itâ€™s dangerous.
- **Error-Based SQL Injection**: Exploiting SQL errors to gain unauthorized access to data.
- **Union-Based SQL Injection**: Using the `UNION` operator to retrieve data from multiple tables.
- **Blind SQL Injection**: Exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities when error messages are not displayed.
- **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection**: Using time delays to infer data when no errors or output are returned.
- **Advanced SQL Injection Techniques**: Exploring more complex methods like out-of-band SQL injection, second-order SQL injection, and more.

Each lab is designed to help you understand the vulnerability, its impact, and how to mitigate it in real-world applications.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Lab 1**: [Description of Lab 1]
- **Lab 2**: [Description of Lab 2]
- **Lab 3**: [Description of Lab 3]
- **...**: [Additional Labs]

Each folder contains the following files:
- `README.md`: Overview of the specific lab and instructions.
- `lab1.py`: Python script to exploit the vulnerability.
- `lab1.txt`: Notes and observations for the lab.
- `lab1_solution.py`: The solution to the challenge.

## Disclaimer

This repository is strictly for educational purposes only. It contains materials and scripts for learning about SQL injection vulnerabilities in a controlled, ethical environment. **Do not use these scripts on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test**.

The labs in this repository are based on the SQL Injection learning path provided by **PortSwigger**. All code in this repository, including scripts and solutions, is my own work and is shared for educational purposes only.

## Acknowledgments

A special thanks to **PortSwigger** for providing the SQL Injection learning path, which has been an invaluable resource for understanding and practicing web application security. Without their educational content, this repository would not have been possible.
